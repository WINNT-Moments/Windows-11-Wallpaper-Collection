This is a collection of every default Windows 11 wallpaper. By no means would I consider Windows 11 a good system, but at least Microsoft knows how to make some good wallpapers.

For more Windows wallpapers, you should check out my repository dedicated entirely to Windows wallpapers! https://github.com/WINNT-Moments/Windows-Wallpaper-Archive
